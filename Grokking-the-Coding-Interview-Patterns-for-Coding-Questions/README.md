## 1. Pattern: Sliding Window

👉 Maximum Sum Subarray of Size K (easy)

### 53. Maximum Subarray

Given an integer array nums, find the contiguous subarray (containing at least one number) which has the largest sum and return its sum.

A subarray is a contiguous part of an array.

Example 1:

Input: nums = [-2,1,-3,4,-1,2,1,-5,4]
Output: 6
Explanation: [4,-1,2,1] has the largest sum = 6.

Example 2:

Input: nums = [1]
Output: 1

Example 3:

Input: nums = [5,4,-1,7,8]
Output: 23
 
Constraints:

1 <= nums.length <= 105
-104 <= nums[i] <= 104

```
/**
 * @param {number[]} nums
 * @return {number}
 */
var maxSubArray = function(nums) {
    
    let sum = nums[0];
    let solution = sum;
    
    if (nums.length <= 1){
        return nums;
    }
    
    for (var i=1; i<nums.length; i++){
        
        sum = Math.max(nums[i], nums[i] + sum);
        
        solution = Math.max(solution, sum);

    }
    
    return solution;
    
};
```






👉 Smallest Subarray with a given sum (easy)

### 209. Minimum Size Subarray Sum

Given an array of positive integers nums and a positive integer target, return the minimal length of a contiguous subarray [numsl, numsl+1, ..., numsr-1, numsr] of which the sum is greater than or equal to target. If there is no such subarray, return 0 instead.

 

Example 1:

Input: target = 7, nums = [2,3,1,2,4,3]

Output: 2
Explanation: The subarray [4,3] has the minimal length under the problem constraint.

Example 2:

Input: target = 4, nums = [1,4,4]
Output: 1

Example 3:

Input: target = 11, nums = [1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1]
Output: 0
 

Constraints:

1 <= target <= 109
1 <= nums.length <= 105
1 <= nums[i] <= 104

```
var minSubArrayLen = function(target, nums) {
    
    let sum = 0;
    let subLength = Infinity;
    
    let left = 0;
    
    for (var i=0; i<nums.length; i++){
        sum += nums[i];
        while (sum >= target){
            sum -= nums[left];
            subLength = Math.min(subLength, i-left+1);
            left++;
        }
        
    }
    
    if (subLength === Infinity){
        return 0;
    }
    
    return subLength;
    
};
```

```
/**
 * @param {number} target
 * @param {number[]} nums
 * @return {number}
 */
var minSubArrayLen = function(target, nums) {
    
    
    let subLength = Infinity;
    
    
    let left = 0;
    let right = 1;
    let count = 2;
    
    if (nums[left] >= target){
        return 1;
    }
    
    let sum = nums[left] + nums[right];
    
    while (right < nums.length){
        if (sum < target){
            right++;
            count++;
            sum += nums[right];
        } else {
            sum -= nums[left];      
            subLength = Math.min(subLength, count);
            count--;
            left++;
        }
        
    }
    
    if (subLength === Infinity){
        return 0;
    }
    
    return subLength;
    
    
};
```




👉 Longest Substring with K Distinct Characters (medium)

👉 Fruits into Baskets (medium)

### 904. Fruit Into Baskets

You are visiting a farm that has a single row of fruit trees arranged from left to right. The trees are represented by an integer array fruits where fruits[i] is the type of fruit the ith tree produces.

You want to collect as much fruit as possible. However, the owner has some strict rules that you must follow:

You only have two baskets, and each basket can only hold a single type of fruit. There is no limit on the amount of fruit each basket can hold.
Starting from any tree of your choice, you must pick exactly one fruit from every tree (including the start tree) while moving to the right. The picked fruits must fit in one of your baskets.
Once you reach a tree with fruit that cannot fit in your baskets, you must stop.
Given the integer array fruits, return the maximum number of fruits you can pick.

 

Example 1:

Input: fruits = [1,2,1]
Output: 3
Explanation: We can pick from all 3 trees.

Example 2:

Input: fruits = [0,1,2,2]
Output: 3
Explanation: We can pick from trees [1,2,2].
If we had started at the first tree, we would only pick from trees [0,1].

Example 3:

Input: fruits = [1,2,3,2,2]
Output: 4
Explanation: We can pick from trees [2,3,2,2].
If we had started at the first tree, we would only pick from trees [1,2].
 

Constraints:

1 <= fruits.length <= 105
0 <= fruits[i] < fruits.length

```
/**
 * @param {number[]} fruits
 * @return {number}
 */
var totalFruit = function(fruits) {
    
    let basket = new Map();
    
    let left = 0;
    let right = 0;
    
    let max = 0;
    
    while (right < fruits.length){
        let eachFruit = fruits[right];
        basket.set(eachFruit, (basket.get(eachFruit) || 0) + 1);
        right++;
        
        if (basket.size > 2){
            let badFruit = fruits[left];
            
            basket.set(badFruit, (basket.get(badFruit)) - 1);
            if (basket.get(badFruit) <= 0){
                basket.delete(badFruit);
            }
            
            left++;
        }
        
        max = Math.max(max, right - left);
    }
    
    return max;
    
};
```



👉 No-repeat Substring (hard)

### 3. Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters

Given a string s, find the length of the longest substring without repeating characters.

 

Example 1:

Input: s = "abcabcbb"
Output: 3
Explanation: The answer is "abc", with the length of 3.

Example 2:

Input: s = "bbbbb"
Output: 1
Explanation: The answer is "b", with the length of 1.

Example 3:

Input: s = "pwwkew"
Output: 3
Explanation: The answer is "wke", with the length of 3.
Notice that the answer must be a substring, "pwke" is a subsequence and not a substring.

```
/**
 * @param {string} s
 * @return {number}
 */
var lengthOfLongestSubstring = function(s) {
    
    let subCount = 0;
    let total = 0;
    
    let left = 0;
    let right = 0;
    
    let checkRepeat = new Map();
    
    while (right < s.length){
        if (checkRepeat.has(s[right])){
            checkRepeat.delete(s[left]);
            left++;
            subCount--;
        } else {
            checkRepeat.set(s[right], 1);
            subCount++;
            right++;
        }
        
        total = Math.max(total, subCount);

    }
    
    return total;
    
};
```
